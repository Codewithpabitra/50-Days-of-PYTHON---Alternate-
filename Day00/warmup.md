# Welcome To the world of PYTHON 

`PYTHON` - is a `high level programming language` . It is very easy to learn and feels like english . It supports `OOP` (Object Oriented Programming) also. Don't worry I will be explaining all the terms later on.

### lets write some code - 

```python

print("Hello world") # this print "Hello world" on the screen 
print("hello from CodeWithPabitra") # this print "hello from CodeWithPabitra"

```

`'print( )'` is a built in function which print (exactly whatever it take) on the screen.
