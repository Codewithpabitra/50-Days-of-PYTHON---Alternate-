# PYTHON - is a high level programming language . It is very easy to learn and feels like english . It supports OOP(Object Oriented Programming) also. Don't worry I will be explaining all the terms later on.

# lets write some code - 

print("Hello world") # this print "Hello world" on the screen 
print("hello from CodeWithPabitra") # this print "hello from CodeWithPabitra"


# ** So, the 'print()' is a built in function which print (exactly whatever it take) on the screen.
